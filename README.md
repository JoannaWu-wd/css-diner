# CSS Diner 🍽️

This repo provides an example of how Codespaces + [CodeSwing](https://aka.ms/codeswing) can enable a platform for interactive tutorials. It's a port of the amazing [CSS Diner](https://flukeout.github.io/) tutorial by [@flukeout](https://twitter.com/flukeout), which helps teach CSS by selecting dancing food-related items from a table!
